# Certainly! - A Simple News Tracker App

Certainly! is a user-friendly web application that consolidates news articles based on different categories. Users can easily select a specific category, click the "Fetch News" button, and the app will promptly display the latest news articles from the chosen category.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Certainly! app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/certainly-news-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd news_tracker
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file:**

   In the root directory, create a file named `.env`. This file will store your environment variables.

4. **Add your API key to the `.env` file:**

   Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following line:

   ```env
   NEWS_API_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here
   ```

   Obtain your API key by logging in to [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/) and retrieving your key. Replace `your-api-key-goes-here` with your actual News API key.

5. **Install `dotenv` package:**

   Run the following command in your project's root directory to install the `dotenv` package:

   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```

   Open two terminals; in one, navigate to the `api` directory and start the server:

7. **Start the server:**

   In the `api` directory:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   Keep this terminal running to keep the server active.

8. **Start the React app:**

   In the root directory:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   This will open the app in your default web browser.
